# Semantic release

This repository uses [semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) for automatically managing changelogs, package versions and GitHub releases. You will find more information in the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md).

If you don't want to use semantic release you can remove the files

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

Also you need to run

```
npm uninstall @semantic-release/changelog @semantic-release/git
```

and remove the `release` option in the `package.json`.
